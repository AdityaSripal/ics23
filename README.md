# Proofs

This is an attempt to define a generic, cross-language, binary representation
of merkle proofs, which can be generated by many underlying merkle tree storage
implementations and validated by many client libraries over various languages.

The end goal is to provide a standard representation not only for light-client
proofs of blockchains, but more specifically for proofs that accompany IBC
(inter-blockchain communication) packets as defined in the cosmos specification.

## Organization

The top level package will provide language-agnostic documentation and protobuf specifications.
Every language should have a sub-folder, containing both protobuf generated code,
as well as client-side code for validating such proofs. The server-side code should
live alongside the various merkle tree representations (eg. not in this repository)
